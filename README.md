Mapping Air Pollutant Severity. A health focused application where patients can input their afflicted health conditions which are individually mapped to a closely related environmental risk factor. These risk factors are used to generate a heatmap that displays the severity of air pollutants in their surrounding area. Ramblin Hackathon 2025
